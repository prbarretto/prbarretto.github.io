    <h3>Project Manager & Web Developer</h3>

    <div class="about-me">
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I realized that web development was something I was interested in pursuing during a project management job while relaying client requests to the development team. I wanted to know how the website was created to better train clients on how to use it, answer their questions and explain  why some features were taking longer to create than others. I also wanted to be able to communicate with the developers in their “language” so that site improvements could be integrated in a  explicit way.
    <br>
    <br>
    I decided that the best way to learn how to make websites through General Assembly's WDI. I didn't know where to get started on learning on my own and I knew that GA could help me learn quickly and efficiently.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am a long-time Boston resident planning to remain in the Boston area in a role that would capitalize on my previous project management skills while further developing  my newly acquired developer skills. I am especially interested in several sectors including education, food, fashion, books, travel, or technology.</p>
